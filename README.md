ðŸŽ‰ Project Showcase ðŸŽ‰



Two semesters ago, we completed a basic web application project as part of our coursework. Recently, I had the opportunity to deploy it on a real server, and Iâ€™m thrilled to finally share it!



This project demonstrates the essentials of web development, combining PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript on the MVC architecture to build a functional and user-friendly application.
